# House Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates a basic regression analysis using a machine learning model to predict house prices based on a dataset named "house". The entire workflow is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- The following Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

To install these libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

csharp


## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `Untitled3.ipynb`: Main notebook with code for loading data, analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset named `house` is expected to be available in the project directory. Make sure the dataset is accessible using:
```python
data = loaddataset("house")
Note: You may need to define or import loaddataset() in your notebook, or replace it with pandas.read_csv("house.csv") if you're using a CSV file.

ðŸš€ How to Run
Open the notebook using Jupyter:

nginx
jupyter notebook Untitled3.ipynb
Run each cell step by step:

Load the dataset

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Train a machine learning model

Evaluate the model

âœ… Results
The notebook will show:

Data visualizations (histograms, correlation plots)

Model performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, RÂ²)

Predictions on test data

ðŸ“Œ Notes
Ensure that the dataset is clean and formatted correctly.

Modify the notebook if you're using a different dataset or features.
